# Welcome to Road To Dev
Welcome to a collection of my knowledge, thoughts and studies in the world of software!

The plan for this repo is to create a centralised location to store and present my findings so I can update them and view them from outside the realms of a normal Word document (and in a prettier way, too).

I will be following a few devloper roadmaps as compiled by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/), focusing on Backend development and ASP.NET Core, as well as continuing my path to becoming a programming wizard on Leetcode. [Check me out!](https://leetcode.com/FilipNaj/)

Let's see how long lasts...
